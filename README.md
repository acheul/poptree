# tree
Make family trees with Graphviz (on python)
  
### To execute:
>> pip install git+https://github.com/acheul/poptree.git<br>
>> from pop_tree import *
  
### Notes
* I higly recommend to work on Google Colab, which have graphviz installed already. Otherwise, it would be quite picky to install and use graphviz.  
* Designing this pack was initially inspired from a work of Ahsen Parwez https://medium.com/@ahsenparwez/building-a-family-tree-with-python-and-graphviz-e4afb8367316
* The main purpose for this pack is to restore and visualize family geneologies from premodern historic data. This is why the family tree here are mainly structured on paternal linkage, that is, on wife-husband and father-son connections.
* Further details will be updated soon ... as I hope.
